# Line Following Robot 🏎️⚡

> **LFR TECHATHON NATIONALISTS 2026** — organized by **IUT Robotics Society**

Our entry for the LFR Techathon Nationalists 2026. PID-controlled autonomous line follower — follows a black line on white surface, goal is simple: reach the finish before everyone else. Speed is everything.

Built from scratch — custom chassis, hand-soldered electronics, and code we iterated on until it stopped embarrassing us on the track.

## How It Works

### Sensor Reading

The 5 IR sensors sit at the front, facing the ground. Each sensor returns a value — high when it sees the black line, low on white surface. We read all 5 and pack them into a 5-bit number:

```
                Black Line
                    ║
  Sensor:   S0   S1  ║S2   S3   S4
            ○    ○   ●    ○    ○       ← S2 sees the line
                     ║
  Bit:      0    0   1    0    0       = B00100 (line is centered)
```

Some more examples:

```
  Line drifted left:
  S0   S1   S2   S3   S4
  ○    ●    ●    ○    ○    = B01100 → error is negative → turn left

  Line drifted right:
  S0   S1   S2   S3   S4
  ○    ○    ○    ●    ○    = B00010 → error is positive → turn right

  Line completely lost:
  S0   S1   S2   S3   S4
  ○    ○    ○    ○    ○    = B00000 → spin in place to recover

  Junction / cross:
  S0   S1   S2   S3   S4
  ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    = B11111 → just go straight through
```

### PID Control

Instead of doing a bunch of `if-else` checks for each pattern, we use PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. Here's the idea:

We assign weights to each sensor based on their position:

```
  Sensor:    S0     S1     S2     S3     S4
  Weight:    -2     -1      0     +1     +2
             ←  LEFT    CENTER    RIGHT  →
```

We calculate a **weighted average** of all the sensors that see the line. This gives us an **error value** from -2.0 (far left) to +2.0 (far right).

```
  Example: S1 and S2 see the line
  Weighted sum = (-1) + (0) = -1
  Active sensors = 2
  Error = -1 / 2 = -0.5  →  line is slightly to the left
```

Then PID kicks in:

```
  correction = Kp × error  +  Ki × integral  +  Kd × derivative
                   │                │                   │
                   │                │                   └─ dampens oscillation
                   │                └─ fixes long-term drift
                   └─ main steering force

  Left motor speed  = BASE_SPEED - correction
  Right motor speed = BASE_SPEED + correction
```

So if error is negative (line to the left), correction is negative, left motor slows down, robot turns left. Simple.

```
  Line to the left (error = -1.5):
  ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
  │ LEFT│ SLOW    │RIGHT│ FAST     → robot turns LEFT ↰
  │motor│ ←──     │motor│ ──→
  └─────┘         └─────┘

  Line centered (error = 0):
  ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
  │ LEFT│ ──→     │RIGHT│ ──→     → robot goes STRAIGHT ↑
  │motor│         │motor│
  └─────┘         └─────┘

  Line to the right (error = +1.5):
  ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
  │ LEFT│ FAST    │RIGHT│ SLOW     → robot turns RIGHT ↱
  │motor│ ──→     │motor│ ←──
  └─────┘         └─────┘
```

### What Happens When the Line is Lost?

If all 5 sensors read white (no line), we remember which direction we last turned and spin in place in that direction until we find the line again:

```
  Lost line, last turn was LEFT:       Lost line, last turn was RIGHT:

      ╔═══╗                                 ╔═══╗
      ║   ║                                 ║   ║
  ←── ║   ║ ──→                         ←── ║   ║ ──→
  REV ╚═══╝ FWD                         FWD ╚═══╝ REV
    spin LEFT ↺                           spin RIGHT ↻
```

## Wiring

```
  Arduino Pin    →    Component
  ─────────────────────────────────
  A0             →    IR Sensor 0 (leftmost)
  A1             →    IR Sensor 1
  A2             →    IR Sensor 2 (center)
  A3             →    IR Sensor 3
  A4             →    IR Sensor 4 (rightmost)
  D5  (PWM)      →    L298N ENA (left motor speed - lms)
  D6             →    L298N IN1 (left motor forward - lmf)
  D7             →    L298N IN2 (left motor backward - lmb)
  D8             →    L298N IN3 (right motor forward - rmf)
  D9             →    L298N IN4 (right motor backward - rmb)
  D10 (PWM)      →    L298N ENB (right motor speed - rms)
```

## File Structure

```
Sensor/
├── Sensor.ino    — main file: setup(), loop(), PID logic, global variables
├── motor.ino     — motor(): handles direction and PWM for both wheels
├── reading.ino   — reading(): reads IR array, debugPrint(): serial output
└── README.md     — you're reading this
```

Arduino IDE automatically merges all `.ino` files in the same folder into one sketch before compiling. The file matching the folder name (`Sensor.ino`) is treated as the main file.

## Tuning Guide

These are the values you'll want to tweak on the actual track:

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `th` | 512 | Sensor cutoff — values above this = "line detected". Check with `debugPrint()`. |
| `BASE_SPEED` | 180 | Forward speed. Higher = faster but harder to control on curves. |
| `Kp` | 30.0 | How aggressively it steers. Too low = misses turns. Too high = wobbles. |
| `Kd` | 20.0 | Dampens the wobble. Increase if robot oscillates side to side. |
| `Ki` | 0.0 | Fixes drift. Only touch this if the robot consistently veers to one side. |

### Tuning steps

1. Start with `BASE_SPEED = 150`, `Kp = 25`, `Kd = 15`, `Ki = 0`
2. Put robot on track, see if it follows the line
3. If it doesn't turn enough on curves → increase `Kp`
4. If it wobbles/oscillates → increase `Kd`
5. Once stable, slowly increase `BASE_SPEED`
6. Comment out `debugPrint()` for final competition run — it slows the loop
